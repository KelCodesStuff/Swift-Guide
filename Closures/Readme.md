# Closures

Closures are self-contained blocks that can be passed around and used in your code.

Global functions and nested functions are both closures. 
Closures can be one of three forms:

- Global functions are closures that have a name and do not capture any values.
- Nested functions are closures that have a name and can capture values from their enclosing function.
- Closure expressions are unnamed closures written in a lightweight syntax that can capture values from their surrounding context.
