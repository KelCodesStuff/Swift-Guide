# Classes and Structures

### Classes are known as reference types.
Reference types are not copied when they are assigned to a variable (var), constant (let), or when they are passed to a function. Instead of copying, a reference to the existing instance is created.

### Structures are known as value types.
Value types are copied when they are assigned to a variable (var), constant (let), or when they are passed to a function.
